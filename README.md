# AntiPhish: Instagram Edition
This program was created to end a scam which has been going on for way too long...

So, if you've been on Instagram long enough ~~and have had at least one gulible person DM you since you created your account~~, you will probably have seen a message similar to this: "This took me 3 hours to make. I hope you like it. https://scam.xyz/g/?&ure=yourusername". Clicking that link takes you to a fake Instagram login page where it prompts you to enter your account password, which will then be used to login into your account and then send the scam message to everyone you have ever messaged on Instagram.


# What AntiPhish actually does & how to use it:

When you receive one of these phishing DMs, copy the link you were sent and paste it into AntiPhish when the program asks, **(make sure to remove your username from the link).** Now, AntiPhish should constantly send fake login information to the scammer's database, the number of fake passwords sent will be displayed in the title of the program; the longer that AntiPhish is running during this stage, the more fake information that is sent.

# The end result of using AntiPhish

- If the scammer's login bot *doesn't use proxies*, it should get rate-limited and therefore not be able to login to any more accounts for a certain amount of time.
- If the scammer's login bot *does use proxies*, the proxies will be used a lot more and will therefore get banned from Instagram much quicker and the scammer will have to pay real money to buy more proxies/bandwidth in order to continue the whole scam.

Either way, it will be very hard to identify real working account login information that has been submitted by actual victims of this scam, amongst all the fake not working login information submitted by AntiPhish in the scammer's database.
